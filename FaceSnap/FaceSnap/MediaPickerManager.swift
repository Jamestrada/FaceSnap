/*the reason we are conforming to UINavigationControllerDelegate is that an object that implements this protocol and acts as a delegate to the nav controller can modify
 behavior when a view controller is pushed or poppped from the stack. the UIImagePickerControllerDelegate protocol defines methods that your delegate object must
 implement to interact with the image picker interface such as when the user either picks an image or movie or even cancels the picker operation.
